# Snake
This is the game Snake.
There is a field surrounded by walls and a wall in the middle. 
Food is spawned random on the field. There is always one food item on the field. The color of the spawned food is the standaard color or can change with each spawn. If you catch the food item, the snake changes color in the color of the food item.
Traps spawn random on the field. There placement changes regulary.
Robbers come from the right of the screen and go to the left. They gradually go faster. Robbers can be turned off. If robbers are turned on, an item regulary appears that slows them down.
Accelerators regulary appear on the field if turned on. They accelerate the player. If the accelerators are turned on, an item regulary appears that slows the player down.
If the snake hits a wall or a trap or a robber, the game is over.
The highest score is kept and changes if a new highscore is reached.

Pygame was used for the graphics.
